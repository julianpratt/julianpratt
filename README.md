Hi, I am Julian Pratt, a retired software developer. 

These repositories enable me to share applications and utilities, with others who may wish to use them. 

There is probably little of general interest here, but the respositories are made public because there is nothing here that needs to be restricted and it is easier to simply open things up.

If you know me, then you'll know how to reach me. If you don't, then this isn't the place to share that information.

julianpratt/julianpratt is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
